# Bot Mention Trigger
This command will get triggered when someone mentions your bot.
The bot will say its prefix as a response to the mention.

# Details
If you are using the `Server Prefixes` extension this command might crash your bot since it's storing the prefix of your bot. Please remove the 7th action (`Store Bot Client Info`).
